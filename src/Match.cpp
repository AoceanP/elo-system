 * This implements the core Elo formula for expected score:
 * E_A = 1 / (1 + 10^((R_B - R_A) / 400))
 *
 * Where:
 * - E_A is the expected score for player A
 * - R_A is player A's rating
 * - R_B is player B's rating
 * - 400 is the scaling constant (standard in chess)
 *
 * What does this mean?
 *
 * If you have a 400-point rating advantage over someone:
 * - 10^(400/400) = 10^1 = 10
 * - 1 / (1 + 10) = 1/11 â‰ˆ 0.09
 * - So the weaker player has only 9% expected win rate
 *
 * If ratings are equal:
 * - 10^(0/400) = 10^0 = 1
 * - 1 / (1 + 1) = 1/2 = 0.5
 * - So both players have 50% expected win rate
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   ratingA - The rating of player A
 *   ratingB - The rating of player B (the opponent)
 *
 * Returns: Expected score between 0 and 1
